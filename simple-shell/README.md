The program implements a simple shell interface that accepts user commands and executes each command in a separate process. The program provides a command prompt where the user inputs a line of command. The shell is responsible for executing the command. The shell program assumes that the first string of the line gives the name of the executable file. The rest of the strings in the line are considered as arguments for the command.
